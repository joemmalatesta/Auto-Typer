Make this into a video :)

So we can go about this a few ways. One way we simply do with no math...
for this, we just change the letterSleep variable to be higher or lower depending on if we need
to increase or decrease the WPM.


Another one we can do with math and less testing. We test with no sleep number at first to find
the time to type each character, depending on the system. 
We then use the original method to find a sweet spot to try and get it every time. 


Not sure we will be able to get it perfect many times in a row. Just running it shows a fair discrepency
